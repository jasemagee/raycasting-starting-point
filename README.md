# Ray Casting Starting Point

A Ray casting demo using [DragonRuby](https://dragonruby.itch.io/dragonruby-gtk). Use WASD (QE to rotate). Code converted from [this excellent article.](https://lodev.org/cgtutor/raycasting.html)

Used as the starting point for creating my game [Maze](https://jasemagee.itch.io/maze).
